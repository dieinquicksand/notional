## What we're looking for

The ideal outcome of a national insurance ship is employment with no-show or the acceptance of a product lead position. As a decentralized autonomous organization, we leverage the capability of blockchain technology to allow for transparency, accountability, and self direction.

Frequently it'll be impossible to give you direction beyond mentoring:  We are working in frontier technology.  We're fond of telling new recruits that they'll probably fail 50 times, and then succeed unexpectedly the 51st.  We're here to guide you through that.
