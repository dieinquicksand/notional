# Kujira report
### Jacob Gadikian, NotionalDAO

Greetings and salutations my friends, in recent weeks I have had a number of spirited discussions with the Kujira community about the nature of open source software and its place in decentralized finance.  Many community members became involved, too. 

It took up too much time, but I guess that in the end, it was a necessary thing, because the issues continue to grow more serious, not less.
