# Proposal 01: Developer team emergency fund
1. __Proposer:__ Vinh Nguyen The
2. __Date:__ 29/12/2021
3. __Location:__ Hanoi, Viet Nam

# Context
From real experience working at Notional, I have faced many situations that need quick money to solve. 

But, for every single funds, no matter how small, developer team has to go through either Ricardo or Jacob first to be approved of such fund which takes 1 - 2 days to resolve. Worst case scenario, Jacob or Ricardo cannot understand fully the situation leading to almost 1 week of approval.

In pressing moments when customers are crying for solutions, 1 - 2 days are too long.

# Solution
A __small__ emergency fund that developer team can use __at will__ and __at any given moment__ is needed to combat the problem above.

The fund will be accounted so that people will know what emergency situation has risen and how much is spent on that situation.

The fund will be transfered to, ideally, Khanh and Long's Visa account.

the exact amount will be 500$ in payable asset (Viet Nam Dong).

# Notice
The proposer shall not hold this emergency fund.
